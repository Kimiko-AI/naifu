# Project Gemini: Diffusion Model Trainer

## Project Overview

This project is a flexible and powerful training framework for diffusion models, built using Python and PyTorch. It provides a modular architecture for training a variety of models, including Stable Diffusion (SD, SDXL), Cascade, and other diffusion-based architectures. The framework is designed to be highly configurable, using YAML files to define training parameters, model architectures, and dataset configurations.

The key technologies used in this project are:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **PyTorch:** The core deep learning framework.
*   **Accelerate:** A library from Hugging Face for distributed training and mixed-precision.
*   **Diffusers:** A library from Hugging Face for working with diffusion models.
*   **Transformers:** A library from Hugging Face for working with transformer-based models.
*   **OmegaConf:** For managing YAML-based configurations.

The project is structured as follows:

*   `trainer.py`: The main entry point for starting a training run.
*   `config/`: Contains YAML configuration files for different training scenarios.
*   `common/`: Contains the core training loop and other shared utilities.
*   `modules/`: Contains the specific training logic for different model types.
*   `models/`: Contains the neural network model architectures.
*   `data/`: Contains data loading and preprocessing utilities.

## Building and Running

### 1. Installation

To run this project, you first need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip and the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running a Training Job

To start a training job, you use the `trainer.py` script and provide a configuration file as an argument. For example, to train an SDXL model, you would run the following command:

```bash
python trainer.py --config config/train_sdxl.yaml
```

You can customize the training by creating your own YAML configuration files or by overriding parameters on the command line.

### 3. TODO: Testing

There are no explicit tests in the project. To ensure the correctness of the training process, it is recommended to add a test suite.

```bash
# TODO: Add a test suite and document the testing commands here.
pytest
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Configuration:** All training parameters should be defined in YAML configuration files in the `config/` directory. This makes it easy to reproduce experiments and share configurations.
*   **Modularity:** The code is organized into modules based on functionality. When adding new features, try to follow this modular structure.
*   **Code Style:** The project follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Use a linter like `flake8` or `black` to ensure your code is formatted correctly.
*   **Docstrings:** All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings that explain their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Logging:** The project uses the `logging` module to log information about the training process. Use the logger to provide informative messages about the status of the training.
